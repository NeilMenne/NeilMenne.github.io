<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Like many blogs in our profession, I begin by focusing on a particular set of
technologies <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>, <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html">Ecto
3</a>, and
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/maestro/api-reference.html">maestro</a> such that this article
is doomed to inevitable obsolescence. Nevertheless, it is a great place for me
to start as it is focused on things that I am actively developing on now and
interested in working on/with for the foreseeable future. Enough with the
character development&hellip; On to the software development!</p>

<h1 id="maestro">Maestro</h1>

<p>Maestro began out of necessity for a project at <a href="https://pylon.com/">Pylon</a>. The
key differentiator between maestro and other open source alternatives for <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event
sourcing</a> in Elixir is the
focus on causal consistency for events. In simpler terms, if you have maestro
running on two nodes that can&rsquo;t see each other (but they can still see the
database), they will make progress without violating each other&rsquo;s view of the
model. How? We require through database transactions that the events are
sequentially ordered. Additionally, a local copy of the model will always make a
best effort to see all previous events before accepting new commands.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll dig into some of the more interesting implementation details at a later
date, but consistency is a cognitive burden that is nice to set aside without
having to complicate the code you write on a day to day basis.</p>

<h1 id="moving-to-ecto-3">Moving to Ecto 3</h1>

<p>Ecto 3 has been out for a while now, so I really have been delinquent in my
responsibilities in maintaining maestro by waiting as long as I have to upgrade
it; however, our application was not going to move Ecto 3 immediately, and I use
integration with an existing application as a way of fully validating certain
design decisions like <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html">dialyzer</a> type
specs.</p>

<p>The first thing I encountered when migrating to v3 was the split between <code>ecto</code>
and <code>ecto_sql</code>. This was written about at length on the elixir blog
<a href="http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2018/10/a-sneak-peek-at-ecto-3-0-breaking-changes/">here</a>,
but I never really looked at where the lines were drawn until now. Because of
existing dependencies in maestro, I found that I had to explicitly specify both
to get my <code>mix deps.get</code> to play nice, but it wasn&rsquo;t required to explicitly
specify <code>ecto</code> afterwards. I assume this was user error, as <code>ecto_sql</code> very
clearly <a href="https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto_sql/blob/49e93b9bcd6606336930b2646cce64193007c79e/mix.exs#L47">depends on
<code>ecto</code></a></p>

<p>Other than that, the changes were mostly painless.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>migrations_path</code> moved from <code>Mix.Ecto</code> to <code>Ecto.Migrator</code></li>
<li><code>:adapter</code> is specified on the <code>Repo</code> and not in config</li>
<li><code>Multi.run/3</code> warns against having a <code>run</code> function with arity 1</li>
<li><code>Ecto.Changeset.unique_constraint</code>&rsquo;s <code>:message</code> must be a string</li>
</ul>

<p>The only one that really surprised me was the last one, but the error message
for <code>FunctionClauseError</code> made it relatively straightforward to track down and
fix. It can be seen <a href="https://github.com/toniqsystems/maestro/blob/7a53de3298ea21f5488bda6593bf8ffd55d6c406/lib/maestro/types/event.ex#L50">here in
maestro</a>
and the relevant line of code in <code>ecto</code> can be seen
<a href="https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto/blob/2d564df57d29ef021f564af36e4b3ab86f902554/lib/ecto/changeset.ex#L2620">here</a>.
I liked having a message that was not just specific but also an atom as it felt
more deliberate as a library developer.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>I really psyched myself out on how much work the migration was going to be. It
is always refreshing to be able to update dependencies and have things play
nicely without much fuss. While your migration to Ecto 3 might be more eventful,
I found it to be a highlight of my OSS programming experience in recent months.</p>

<p>In upcoming posts, I&rsquo;m going to work on a sample application that uses maestro.
It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve had to greenfield a project with it, so now is a
great time to sit down and dig back in. The documentation will be tested. I&rsquo;ll
also use the opportunity to talk about the design decisions which might be more
interesting than the sample app itself.</p>
